		<h2>What are there so much files?</h2>
		<p>The number of files are required to keep everything organised and not make 
			everything a big hodgepodge. The basis of the program is made my main.py which
			will house the most important parts like the webscraping bit and uniting all the
			other programs. File seeker is a program which takes the given values and gives it
			to the main program. Mailing takes the value from computer os and main.py
			and mails the program to the given recipient. Config.json contains the settings
			required for the project; like weather url, the message and the subject.
